                When I am not at my computer working on my projects, you can most likely find me in the kitchen, at my grill or on the water.

              There is nothing better than sharing good food and drinks with your family and friends.
              I am fortunate enough to live in such a diverse area where all kinds of different cultures share their cuisine and their exotic ingredients.
              Great memories are made over some slow cooked BBQ, homemade sides and a freshly baked dessert.

              My joy in life is my rescued tuxedo cat "Bat." He tries his best to help me code,
              but his way of helping is walking all over my keyboard.
